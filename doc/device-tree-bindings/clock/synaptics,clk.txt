* Synptics clock control unit

By using he Synptics clock controller, various clock setting can be applied
to controllers and peripherals within the SoC.

Note: now we only support the source from syspll. will be supported later
from avpll

Required Properties:

Clock:
- compatible: should be "synaptics,generic-clock"
- reg: clock control register physical base address and length
- #clock-cells = <0>;
- clk_src: now we only have syspll available
- clk_div: the divder and the freq = (freq of src) / div
	available value: 0(no div), 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
- clk_freq: aimed frequency

Example: Clock controller node:

	emmc_clk: emmc_clk {
		compatible = "synaptics,generic-clock";
		reg = <0xea0540 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clk_div = <4>;
		clk_src = <SRC_SYSPLL_CLKO1>;
		clk_freq = <200000000>;
	};

Gate:
- compatible: should be "synaptics,generic-gate"
- reg: clock gate control register physical address and size
- #clock-cells = <1>;

Example: Gate controller node:
	emmc_gate: emmc_gate {
		compatible = "synaptics,generic-gate";
		reg = <0xea0514 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
